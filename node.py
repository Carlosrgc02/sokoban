    * Name of the original author: Carlos Ruiz Garc√≠a-Casarrios

    * Description of the class: The Node class represents a single node in
    * the search tree or graph. It contains attributes that describe the
    * node's state, its parent node, its depth in the search, the cost to
    * reach it, its heuristic value, and the action that led to it. The
    * class also includes methods to assign a value based on the search
    * strategy, track the path to the root, and represent the node as a
    * string.
